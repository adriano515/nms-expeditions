     description: "I have a theory this number is used to allow people to replay expeditions when they are re-released. If so, and you want to replay an expedition on your main save, you should probably change the number to something really high, like 10000 so it won't block you from playing future re-releases of expeditions."
     warning: Changing this number *could* affect your ability to play future expeditions on your main save.
