          * Freighters are very buggy in this expedition and they can be hard to acquire. A patch has been created to start you off with a freighter. This patch also rewards you with the first part of the pirate map as the P1M3 reward, since that can also be very buggy.

          * If you have an existing save in this expedition and need the pirate map fragment 1, use a save editor to give yourself the `PIRATE_MAPPROD0` item.

          * **Permadeath warning:** It may not be possible to finish this expedition in permadeath mode. If you can avoid death until the final milestone, your save may or may not be deleted by "submitting."

          * The community milestones cannot be completed offline. A patch has been created to replace them with other milestones (ignore the message about Vile Spawns, you can collect them at any time). Unfortunately the Memory Fragments never upgrade.

          * Claiming frigate rewards currently crashes the game. A patch has been created to swap some rewards around and make the frigate reward milestone "optional." You cannot claim the frigate from the milestone, but after completing the expedition you can claim it from the QuickSilver vendor on the Anomaly. **To end the expedition and transfer items to your primary save:** go to the Anomaly, open the expedition terminal, click "End Expedition"

          * This expedition breaks a lot, in particular the "reset save on death" mechanic. It seems to be working now, but if it breaks you can use the patch to disable it.
