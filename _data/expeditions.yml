  # notice: This expedition has a milestone to die. If you do the milestone on Permadeath, your expedition and main save will be deleted!
  notice: >
          * The `ResetSaveOnDeath` mechanic is currently broken. Your save file will break if it is enabled and you die. Use the patch below to turn the `ResetSaveOnDeath` mechanic off.

          <br><br>If your save is currently broken, you will need to use a save editor (like NomNom or NMSSaveeditor) to fix it. Renaming the "ExpeditionContext" key (or deleting the object if you know what you're doing) in the JSON should work. Make a backup of your save first just in case.

          * The community milestones cannot be completed offline. Use the patch below to replace them with other milestones.
